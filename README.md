Code Blog Basic .NET Project. Included MVC, Routing and Partial View Titles.

Project was created withModel, View, Controller structure. 
Fixed areas are separated as Header and Footer to prevent the codes from repeating. 
Changed fields were kept in View and rendered in _Layout. 
Header and Footer were Partial in _Layout. 
Routing process was done to avoid writing the names of Controller and method in the URL.
